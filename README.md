## Overview

This project is a solution to the Minimal Blog Card challenge from devChallenges.io. It's a simple, responsive blog card design. The main container adapts to different screen sizes, and the card's content is styled to be clean and minimal.

### What I learned

The main difficulty I faced was getting the image to fit correctly inside the container while maintaining its aspect ratio and responsiveness. I learned how to properly use `display: flex` and `border-radius` to achieve the desired layout and styling. The rest of the styling, including typography and colors, was straightforward.

### Useful resources

- [devChallenges.io](https://www.devchallenges.io) - The platform that provided the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries for responsiveness

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge. Key features include:

- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- A clean and minimal design.
- The use of CSS custom properties for colors and fonts.
- A well-structured HTML file with semantic tags.

## Acknowledgements
